# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing local MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for design system documentation into a remote server that can be accessed over HTTP/WebSocket connections. The current server runs locally via stdio transport and requires users to download, configure, and run the server on their machines. The remote server will be hosted centrally, allowing users to connect directly without local installation while maintaining all existing functionality and adding new capabilities for remote access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Claude Desktop user, I want to connect to a remote MCP server without downloading or configuring anything locally, so that I can access design system documentation immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures Claude Desktop with a remote server URL THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection to the remote server
2. WHEN the connection is established THEN the system SHALL provide all existing MCP tools (list-categories, list-components, get-component-details, search-design-system)
3. WHEN the user queries the design system THEN the system SHALL return the same data format as the local version
4. IF the remote server is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating connection issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy the MCP server to a cloud platform with optional authentication and rate limiting, so that I can control access and prevent abuse while keeping public documentation accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the server THEN the system SHALL support environment-based configuration for different deployment environments
2. WHEN accessing public documentation THEN the system SHALL allow unauthenticated requests for public content
3. WHEN accessing internal documentation THEN the system SHALL require authentication using API keys or tokens
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
5. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables and configuration
6. IF authentication is required but fails THEN the system SHALL reject the connection with a 401 Unauthorized response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the remote server to maintain backward compatibility with existing local configurations, so that current users can migrate seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing users update their configuration THEN the system SHALL support both local and remote server configurations
2. WHEN the remote server processes requests THEN the system SHALL return identical response formats to the local version
3. WHEN dual-source documentation features are enabled THEN the system SHALL work with both public and internal documentation sources
4. IF a user has existing local configuration THEN the system SHALL provide migration instructions and tools

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging for the remote server, so that I can track usage, debug issues, and ensure system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log request details, response times, and error conditions
2. WHEN system health is checked THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints for monitoring
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN usage metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL track and report API usage statistics
5. IF the system experiences issues THEN the system SHALL provide structured logs for troubleshooting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want the remote server to implement proper security measures including HTTPS, CORS, and input validation, so that the system is secure for production use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is deployed THEN the system SHALL enforce HTTPS for all connections
2. WHEN cross-origin requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper CORS policies
3. WHEN user input is received THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all input parameters
4. WHEN sensitive data is handled THEN the system SHALL not log or expose authentication tokens or private repository content
5. IF malicious requests are detected THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and request filtering

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the MCP server, I want comprehensive API documentation and client examples, so that I can easily integrate the remote server into different applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers need integration guidance THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
2. WHEN multiple client types need support THEN the system SHALL provide examples for Claude Desktop, Amazon Q, and direct HTTP clients
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL document all authentication methods and token management
4. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the system SHALL provide debugging guides and common error solutions
5. IF new features are added THEN the system SHALL maintain up-to-date documentation with version information
